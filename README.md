# Case Study: Customer Clustering for Fitness-Startup

### Project Description

This project was carried out for a fitness startup (online shop supplement manufacturer) that already has an extensive customer base. The goal is to gain insights into the characteristics of the existing customers through clustering methods. These insights will be used to develop targeted strategies for increasing revenue and improving customer retention. This can be considered as the first part of the implementation of a recommender system.

The project was implemented using Python 3.11.
